            <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound(450g) ground beef or Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic,minced</li>
            <li>1 can(28 ounces/800g) crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 can(14 ounces/400g) tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper (or to taste)</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>Fresh basil or parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the noodles and set them aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until the onion is translucent and the garlic is fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper to the skillet. Stir well to combine all the ingredients. Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with 1 cup of shredded mozzarella and 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan. Mix well.</li>
            <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place three lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping them.</li>
            <li>Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Top it with a layer of meat sauce. Repeat these layers until you've used up all the ingredients, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese over the top of the lasagna.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before serving. This allows the lasagna to set and makes it easier to slice.</li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh basil or parsley, if desired, and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
